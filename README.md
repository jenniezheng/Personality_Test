# Personality-Test

This test was made Janrauary 2016. I created the website while Michael Mech wrote the questions and answers. 
I used googledrive to host the website mainly because my school blocked most other websites, but moved it to github in September after 
googledrive stopped allowing website hosting. I used only css, html, and javascript when other languages like jquery and bootstrap
would have been more convenient because google drive didn't support many languages.
