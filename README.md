# Personality Test
I created the website for this personality test around January 2016. At the time I knew nothing about web development and was simply learning by fumbling around. Looking back, I've improved quite a lot since then. 
You can figure out your personality type in this thorough, 80 question long, branched test: https://jenniezheng321.github.io/Personality-Test/
